# Viewport scaling
Single header utility for getting rectangles to use for scaling viewport texture (Raylib RenderTexture as an example) to the window.

To get the function implementation part use `#define VIEWPORT_SCALING_IMPLEMENTATION` before including the header.    
There is an example for Raylib.
